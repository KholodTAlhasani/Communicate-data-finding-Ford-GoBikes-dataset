## Dataset

> In this analysis three datasets were used to investigate Ford GoBike system through the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. data taken from this web page (https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html), datasets was separated by months in files. these files were  combined in one file for each year.  the features used in this analysis were the ones in common between the three datasets 13 features in common. These datasets contains data about the users type how use this services, number of the trips, distant of the trips, duration and used stations at the beginning and end of trips.
First univariate exploration was done using one variable at a time. Investigating the numbers of users per month/ day, common stations in the city to start the trips and number of users subscribers vs Customer each year.

> For Bivariate Exploration, I investigated trip duration vs user type (Subscriber and customers), User type count during the year, User type numbers per weekday, Trip duration per station.

> Multivariate Exploration, Daily trip duration according to user type, Monthly trip duration according to user type and Trip duration spent by user type per stations was investigated.



## Summary of Findings

> The finding are very similar in all years. Type of users, each type revealed different pattern during the use of the service in terms trip duration, time during the week/month, used stations and number of weekly and daily trips.
Subscribers how hold a membership in the service shows behaviour of regular commute (to work for example). They tend to have steady counts of trips per weekday and drop in trip counts in the weekend (Saturday & Sunday). In the other side, customers have steady number of trips every day with slight increase in weekend during the year 2017/18. This may indicate that customers could be tourist or users how use the service as an activity or in holidays.
Regarding the daily duration of their trips, Subscribers shows steady average trip duration during the week while customers tend to spend more time during the weekend.

>in this analysis, the used stations were also investigated, finding that both Subscribers and customers prefer certain stations in the city. These stations have the highest number of trips taken by users in all years. In two of these station users tend to spend longer trip duration than the rest of the station. This could be due to either the location of the station ( the centre of the city for example) or the working hours of the stations. With Multivariant analysis revealed that customers tend to spend longer trip time in these specific stations while subscribers spend almost the same trip duration in all stations.



## Key Insights for Presentation
> in the presentation i focused more on the difference behaviour in user type in term of trip duration, used station, trip counts in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Number of users type (subscribers vs Customer)
Average trip duration per user type
Daily trip duration spent by user type per stations
Daily number of trips per user type

 Number of users type (subscribers vs Customer) pie chart showed that the subscriber users are always in higher percentages than customers how do not have a membership in Ford GoBike. a large percentage ranging from 79 to 85% of users in the three years are users with membership.
Average trip duration per user type showing customers tend to have longer bike trips than the subscriber how tend to use bikes for less time 11 min while 22-42 min for the Customers.

Daily trip duration spent by user type per stations. In subscribers, trip duration is not affected by different stations they use the stations in the same proportion. While customers trip duration have variation depending on the station. customers spend longer time in their trips when using San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza) interestingly in all years. This could be due to either the location of the station ( the centre of the city for example) or it has longer working hours.


Daily number of trips per user type, line plot represent the daily number of trips for each user type. the subscriber curve shows steep decrease in trips counts in weekend days, while the customer curve showes steady curve with slight increase in weekend( Saturday, Sunday). this appears more in the years 17/18.
